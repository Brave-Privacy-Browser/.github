## About Brave Browser
Brave is a next-generation web browser built on the Chromium engine but fundamentally reimagined for privacy, speed, and user empowerment. Its core philosophy challenges the traditional surveillance-based advertising model of the web. By blocking trackers and ads by default, Brave significantly increases page load speeds—often making pages load 3-6x faster than in conventional browsers—while simultaneously preventing companies from collecting your browsing data without consent. This creates a cleaner, less cluttered, and more secure browsing experience from the moment you first launch it.

Beyond privacy, Brave introduces an innovative economic model through its Brave Rewards system. Users can choose to enable privacy-preserving ads and earn BAT, a cryptocurrency token, for their attention. This BAT can be automatically contributed to websites and creators they visit or held in the integrated wallet. The browser also bundles premium privacy services that other browsers lack, such as a free, limited-tier VPN and a firewall for mobile devices. With its growing suite of built-in tools and commitment to a privacy-by-default web, Brave positions itself not just as an alternative browser, but as a comprehensive platform for a more respectful and efficient online experience.
